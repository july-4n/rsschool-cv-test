## About
I want to be a front-end developer. My strong sides are assiduity, attention to details. I've started to learn HTML, CSS and JS since summer of 2019, but I didn't have enough time to immerse myself in studies. I have little experience with programming. I transfered markup from Bitrix to WordPress and I participated in the layout of several projects during the internship.

## Skills
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap, SASS/SCSS/LESS, BEM)
* JavaScript (basic)
* Git/GitHub
* Figma, Avocode, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator
* VS Code, Atom
* 1C Bitrix(basic)
* Bitrix24, WordPress

## Code example
```javascript
function alphabetPosition(text) {
  let alphabetArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'];

  let testArray = text.toLowerCase().split('');

  text = '';

  for(let i = 0; i < testArray.length; i++) {
    for(let k = 0; k < alphabetArray.length; k++) {
      if (testArray[i] == alphabetArray[k]) {
        text += k + 1 + ' ';
      }
    }
  }
  return text.trim();
}
```
